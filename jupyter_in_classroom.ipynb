    "## About notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fun fact\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks---originally IPython notebooks---were invented by [Fernando Perez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_P%C3%A9rez_(software_developer)) when he was a physics PhD student here at CU Boulder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing locally\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to install the software is to install the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Once installed, you can launch a notebook \"server\" (a browser app) either through the Anaconda app, or by opening a command window and running: `jupyter notebook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binder and other JupyterHub servers\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to run notebooks on a remote system that's running a JupyterHub server. One free resource is [**Binder**](https://mybinder.org/). CU Research Computing offered a prototype JupyterHub server for teaching in 2019-20; last I checked, they didn't have the resources to continue it in 2020-21 but that may change. CSDMS has a cloud-based server that we use for workshops."
